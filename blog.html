										<h2>Comparing yourself. - July 1st 2015</h2>
										<p>In a good way?</p>
									</header>
									<p>One of the easiest ways to kill your self-esteem is by comparing yourself with others. We tend to do it unintentionally which often results in ourselves spiralling down a dark and secluded path. It is inevitable to find yourself looping in series of doubt and chaos when questioning one's self-worth to society. One of the most important things I've learned in these past few years of living is the thought of "relativity." It is what we don't have that we crave but what we have that becomes privelege. Get it? Just stay with me. Being in such a competitive university, I've always compared myself to everyone; people whom have prospered in their field doing something they love and sought and accomplished their goals. It really sucks to feel less than someone but it shouldn't be like that. We should train our minds not to envy but to be inspired and not to belittle self-worth but to invirograte self-confidence. We should compare ourselves with whom we perceive as accomplished and successful (no matter in what they do) and seek to give admiration and most importantly understanding that if they can do it, you can do it too. I believe I can accept not being the best at certain things but I can't accept not being the best person I can be. If I am negative and depressed about not being the best, am I the best person I can be at that moment? Definitely not - a positive and motivated me is much better. It is okay not to be the best at one thing because our mind is set to be great at many things and searching for those unique talents is what makes life tedious and fun. We should approach challenges similar to throwing ninja stars. Every star you throw - you give it your utmost precision and power to hit the target but often times it doesn't hit the red dot in the middle thus you throw again and again in different angles until one does. The bullseye is not the same for everyone similar that not everyone is the same. The only thing that a person can control with the ninja stars is to be obsess with throwing it and with that obsession comes greatness. </p>

									<p>We should take the success of others and acknowledge their approaches and aim to do better if not differently better (makes sense?). While I'm still trying to encompass this perception of positive comparison into my life, I believe it has helped me push for a greater self. Whether you're comparing yourself to the top students of your class or simply that dude that seems to be getting all the ladies, remember that it is all relative and that they might change the world but there is no rules bounding you from doing better. </p>

									<h3>Welcome to my Blog! - July 1st 2015</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span><i>Hello world!</i> I will be giving a daily dose of Danny in this blog. Everything from current tech to everyday thoughts, I'm hoping to make this a hub where my ramblings find a home. Experiences in hackathons and working with teams will be a big one here for sure! I haven't really thought about how often I will be writing but hopefully a ton. I'm going to dedicate an hour or so a week to let myself indulge in this blog. Does this count as a diary? Maybeeee but a blog sounds more manly aha. So writing to who? I'm not very picky. Whether you're an employer browsing my website (btw <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/dannyeng">I'm your man</a>) or a passerby who've just stumbled onto my page by accident, my goal is to share my weird insights and abnormal perspectives to everyone as well as to myself - in the future self. My mind's a mixture of odd concoctions so I'll promise it'll be interesting at the very least...Maybe even a tint of humor. I'm no Kim Kardasian but I'll try to blog as much as I can with what I have! </p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span><strong>A little about me.</strong> I'm born into a Chinese-Canadian immigrant household from two hardworking and insipirational parents along with a slightly irritating but unable to live without older sister. I'm currently a student at an university known for their superior tech startups and innovative alumnis. I consider myself (or would like to aha) a very happy dude with an insane obsession for success. I was raised in my dad's family-owned store since I was two and sold my <b>first toaster</b> to a customer before I could even walk (a little exageration but close enough). The business mentality was embedded in my mind at an incredibly early stage and has been one of my loves since. At the age of fourteen, I began exploring the world of coding, specifically with Turing (wah? really?). I wasn't particularly talented at it at first but witnessing code turn into a little red circle changed my life thus comes my passion for developing. My ultimate goal/career target is to seek a position where I can combine my love for business to my passion for software to <u>change the world</u> (dam that escalated quickly). But yeah, I'm going to stop here. Don't want to overwhelm you with just the first post! Stay tuned! </p>
